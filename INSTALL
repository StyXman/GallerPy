Requirements
------------
* Python 2.2 or newer
* Python Imaging Library - http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
* Psyco (optional) - http://psyco.sourceforge.net/


Installation
------------
1. You've obviously already unpacked the .tar.gz, now you need to copy the
   files gallery directory:
   
   $ cp * ~/www.kapow.com/gallery


2. If you don't like the default options, edit your copy of 'gallerpy.conf'.


3. Now you need to do some Apache modifying. If you just want a single vhost
   with gallery magic, you'll need something like this in your httpd.conf:
   
   <VirtualHost www.kapow.com>
       # normal vhost options
       <Directory /home/woof/www.kapow.com/gallery>
           AddHandler cgi-script .py
           DirectoryIndex index.py
           Options +ExecCGI
       </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>
   
   Or if your web host allows it, you can do it with a .htaccess file in your
   gallery directory:   
   
   AddHandler cgi-script .py
   DirectoryIndex index.py
   Options +ExecCGI


4. Finally, make your thumbs directory and get things ready:
   
   $ mkdir thumbs
   $ chmod 777 thumbs      (world writable, so Apache can write to it)
   $ chmod 755 index.py    (executable, so it works)


5. Test it out! If you get a 500 Interal server error, try running index.py
   from the command line:
   
   $ python index.py
   
   If it works there, try changing the first line of index.py to point to
   your python binary ('which python').
