-------------------
0.5.0    2004-12-??
-------------------
* Split most of the interesting code into gallerpy.py, it makes no sense
  to have huge chunks of duplicated code in index and genthumbs. This
  will also make it easier to embed a gallery into a Python web app.

-------------------
0.4.0    2004-11-12
-------------------
* First public release!
* Various cleanups.
* genthumbs.py will now remove any stale thumbnails after it's finished
  generating.

-------------------
0.3.0    2004-04-17
-------------------
* Change all of the HTML generation code to use a simple template for
  display instead of littering it all around the code.
* Add error handling for image files that aren't openable.

-------------------
0.2.0    2004-04-13
-------------------
* Change the config file so it's read from gallerpy.conf in the current
  directory.
* Don't display/thumbnail our folder image if it's inside the gallery.
* Don't let people enter hidden directories manually. This fixes a nasty
  issue with going into thumbs, oops :)
