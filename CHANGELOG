-------------------
0.5.2    2004-12-??
-------------------
* Included 'croncheck.py'. Edit the CHECKME section under the license,
  then run it regularly from your crontab to restart your SCGI daemons.
  Very useful if your web host ever gets restarted or whatever.
* Updated the default template and some bits and pieces of internal code
  to XHTML 1.1, and properly indented code.
* Updated the CSS to use 'safer' sizing values. Some slightly larger
  folder/thumbnail boxes help with IE5/6 and it's weird layout.
* Fix the pidfile writing/unlinking in scgi_daemon.py.

-------------------
0.5.1    2004-12-08
-------------------
* Update INSTALL_SCGI to try and make it slightly more understandable.
* Add a 'sort_alphabetically' option, see gallerpy.conf for details.
* Fix non-lowercase extension image display.
* Fix SCGI caching logic to actually work properly.
* Fix ShowError calling sys.exit, which would kill the scgi_daemon
  process.. trashing our cache.
* Remove the temporary logging code I left in. You'll probably want
  to delete /tmp/silly.log and /tmp/squishy.log if they exist.

-------------------
0.5.0    2004-12-07
-------------------
* Added 'use_resized' and 'resized_width'/'resized_height' options
* Split most of the interesting code into gallerpy.py, it makes no sense
  to have huge chunks of duplicated code in index and genthumbs. This
  will also (hopefully) make it easier to embed a gallery into a Python
  web app.
* Added an SCGI handler daemon with some sexy caching. Speedup seems to
  be around 10x :) See INSTALL_SCGI for some bad instructions on using it.
* Added an option to set the image resize method. See sample.conf for
  details.
* Try to find the template relative to the script path. This should help
  if someone is crazy enough to try embedding GallerPy into something.

-------------------
0.4.0    2004-11-12
-------------------
* First public release!
* Various cleanups.
* genthumbs.py will now remove any stale thumbnails after it's finished
  generating.

-------------------
0.3.0    2004-04-17
-------------------
* Change all of the HTML generation code to use a simple template for
  display instead of littering it all around the code.
* Add error handling for image files that aren't openable.

-------------------
0.2.0    2004-04-13
-------------------
* Change the config file so it's read from gallerpy.conf in the current
  directory.
* Don't display/thumbnail our folder image if it's inside the gallery.
* Don't let people enter hidden directories manually. This fixes a nasty
  issue with going into thumbs, oops :)
