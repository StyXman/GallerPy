-------------------
0.6.1    2005-??-??
-------------------
* Include .JPE in the list of recognised extensions.
* Include .BMP in the list of recognised extensions, but don't make any extra
  effort to import it's opener early.

-------------------
0.6.0    2004-12-28
-------------------
* Added a 'header_file' option, which displays the contents of a text file if
  it exists in the current directory. See gallerpy.conf for details.
* Added GZIP encoding support. See gallerpy.conf for details.
* Added 'croncheck.py'. Edit the CHECKME section under the license, then run
  it regularly from your crontab to restart your SCGI daemons. Very useful if
  your web host ever gets restarted or whatever.
* Updated the default template and some bits and pieces of internal code to
  use proper indenting, and also valid XHTML 1.1.
* Updated the CSS to use 'safer' sizing values. Taller folder/thumbnail divs
  also help with IE5/6 and it's weird layout engine.
* Changed scgi_daemon.py to use -L for log filename so it matches -P.
* Fixed our except hook. We no longer need the nasty-looking cgitb, yay!
* Fixed the pidfile writing/unlinking in scgi_daemon.py.
* Fixed generate_thumbnails so it catches exceptions properly.
* Fixed the encoded and 'normal' filenames for prev/next image being switched
  in image display mode.
* Fixed image display not having prev/next links if there is a non-image as
  the prev/next file.
* Various minor cleanups.

-------------------
0.5.1    2004-12-08
-------------------
* Update INSTALL_SCGI to try and make it slightly more understandable.
* Add a 'sort_alphabetically' option, see gallerpy.conf for details.
* Fixed non-lowercase extension image display.
* Fixed SCGI caching logic so that it actually works properly.
* Fixed ShowError calling sys.exit, which would kill the scgi_daemon process,
  trashing our cache. Oops.
* Remove the temporary logging code I left in. You'll probably want to delete
  /tmp/silly.log and /tmp/squishy.log if they exist.

-------------------
0.5.0    2004-12-07
-------------------
* Added 'use_resized' and 'resized_width'/'resized_height' options
* Split most of the interesting code into gallerpy.py, it makes no sense to
  have huge chunks of duplicated code in index and genthumbs. This will also
  (hopefully) make it easier to embed a gallery into a Python web app.
* Added an SCGI handler daemon with some sexy caching. Speedup seems to be
  around 10x :) See INSTALL_SCGI for some bad instructions on using it.
* Added an option to set the image resize method. See gallerpy.conf for more
  details.
* Try to find the template relative to the script path. This should help if
  someone is crazy enough to try embedding GallerPy into something.

-------------------
0.4.0    2004-11-12
-------------------
* First public release!
* Various cleanups.
* genthumbs.py will now remove any stale thumbnails after it has finished
  generating new ones.

-------------------
0.3.0    2004-04-17
-------------------
* Change all of the HTML generation code to use a simple template for display
  instead of littering it all around the code.
* Add error handling for image files that aren't openable.

-------------------
0.2.0    2004-04-13
-------------------
* Change the config so it's read from gallerpy.conf in the current directory.
* Don't display/thumbnail our folder image if it's inside the gallery.
* Don't let people enter hidden directories manually. This fixes a nasty DoS
  by someone repeatedly accessing your thumbnail directory.

-------------------
0.1.0    2004-04-12
-------------------
* First release.
