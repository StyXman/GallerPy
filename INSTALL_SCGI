Requirements

* SCGI (http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/scgi/)


Installation
------------
1. I assume you already have GallerPy working as a CGI, so I'll just list the
   steps to adjust it for SCGI here.


2. You need to install mod_scgi and the scgi Python module. If you're using
   FreeBSD, try /usr/ports/www/mod_scgi and /usr/ports/www/py-scgi. If you're
   not, read the docs in the SCGI distribution!


3. Run "python scgi_daemon.py -Zhfjahd" so it prints the usage information, you
   might want to change the port and so on. Then run it with your selected options
   and -F, so you can see if it blows up.


4. In your Apache config, you need to add something like this:
   
   <Location "/gp">
       SCGIHandler On
       SCGIServer localhost:35001
   </Location>


5. That's it. Assuming your image files are in the GallerPy directory, your shiny
   new SCGI server should Just Work(tm).
