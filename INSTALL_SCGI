* SCGI (http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/scgi/)


Installation
------------
1. I assume you already have GallerPy working as a CGI, so I'll just list the
   steps to adjust it for SCGI here.


2. You need to install mod_scgi and the scgi Python module. If you're using
   FreeBSD, try /usr/ports/www/mod_scgi and /usr/ports/www/py-scgi. If you're
   not, read the docs in the SCGI distribution!


3. Run "python scgi_daemon.py -Zhfjahd" so it prints the usage information, you
   might want to change the port and so on. Then just run it with whatever
   options you feel like using.


4. In your Apache config, you need to add something like this:
   
   <Location "/gp">
       SCGIHandler On
       SCGIServer localhost:35001
   </Location>
   
   If the GallerPy code lives in "/gallery/", for instance, you need to change the
   Location to "/gallery/gp". You'll also need to open up scgi_daemon.py, find the
   "prefix = '/gp'" line and change the path to '/gallery/gp' (or whatever).


5. That's it. Assuming your image files are in the GallerPy directory, your shiny
   new SCGI server should Just Work(tm).
